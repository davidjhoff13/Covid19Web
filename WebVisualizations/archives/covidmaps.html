          <p><strong>Tracking Impact Across the United States</strong></p>
          <p>As the novel coronavirus has spread across the globe, the United States has been hit the hardest. 
            It has had more cases and Covid-19 deaths than any other country. But the impact hasn't been uniform. 
          </p>
          <ul>
            <il>
              The death rate has been highest on the East Coast, with the epicenter being New York and New Jersey.
            </il>
            <il>In the center of the country, Illinois, Louisiana, and Nebraska have the highest death rates per person.
            </il>
          <il>Rural states such as Maine, West Virginia, Montana, and Oregon have had the lowest death rates as of early June
            </il>
          </ul>

          <p>The state-by-state map doesn't provide a complete picture of the virus' geographic impact.
          </p>
        
          <h3>Data Notes</h3>
          <p>All maps, charts, and statistical analysis is based on CDC data of number of deaths at the state and county levels. 
            The analysis is of deaths per 100,000 population for all geographic areas. The data were last updated on June 3.
